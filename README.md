# TVC_Control

Code development for the thrust vector mount I built for a model rocket
The code is currently is rudimentary and is only intended to be used for static-fire tests

Potential future updates include:
- obtaining and calculating orientation using IMUs
- calculating the state of the rocket using a barometric pressure sensor
- implementing a PID controller to control TVC
